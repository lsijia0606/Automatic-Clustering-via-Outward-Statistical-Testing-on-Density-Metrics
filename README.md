# Automatic-Clustering-via-Outward-Statistical-Testing-on-Density-Metrics
This algorithm proposes a new clustering algorithm that can detect the clustering centers automatically via statistical testing. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first defines a new metric to measure the density of an object that is more robust to the preassigned parameter, further generates a metric to evaluate the centrality of each object. Afterwards, it identifies the objects with extremely large centrality metrics as the clustering centers via an outward statistical testing method. Finally, it groups the remaining objects into clusters containing their nearest neighbors with higher density.
